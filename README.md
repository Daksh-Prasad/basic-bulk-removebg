# Basic-Bulk-Removebg
This simple python project removes the background of images bulk, you can remove the background of how many ever images you want.
I will be adding more advanced background removers soon, using trained models!

## Setup Instructions
1. Download ZIP
2. Unzip the folder
3. Go to the folder and make 2 files inside it; 'input_images' and 'output_images'
4. Put the images you want to remove the background of into 'input_images'
5. Go to Visual Studio Code
6. On the top of the screen click on 'File' then 'Open folder' then click on the folder you just downloaded
7. Go to Terminal and type 'pip install rembg', let it install
8. Go to 'main.py' and click on run
9. When you are first running this code, it will take some time as it is the first time
10. It should say 'Processed:' followed by your file name in the terminal, this means that that file's background has been removed
11. Go to 'output_images' and your background removed files should be there!
